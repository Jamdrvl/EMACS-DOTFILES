This is my EMACS dotfiles. I've already implemented some minor QOL changes and overall experience improvement.
I plan on concatenating this project with another one - general-use dotfiles attached to an auto-setup script for
my themes, browser config and etc...

For this configs to work, i strongly recommend you download the python tools "ty", from astral and "ruff". YOu can install them both by using UV
